        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p>Take a step back in time on a century-old cable car and see the best 
            views of downtown Pittsburgh while riding one of the few remaining 
            inclines in the country. Opened on May 20, 1877, the Duquesne 
            Incline was rescued and restored by a group of local residents in 
            1963 and still delights residents and visitors with its original, 
            elegant, wooden cable cars. Now you can visit the interior of the 
            incline and watch the machinery while it operates. The Duquesne 
            Incline's upper station houses a museum of Pittsburgh history, 
            including photos and a storehouse of information on inclines from 
            around the world. Unusual Pittsburgh souvenirs, maps and photos can 
            be found at the gift shop.</p><hr>
        <h4> Early History </h4>
        <p> The Duquesne Incline is one of those which follows very closely the 
            tracks of an early coal hoist. Old newspapers indicate the existence
             of such a conveyance as early as 1854. Residents apparently 
             referred to it as "Kirk Lewis' incline" and located it on the 
             present site of The Duquesne Incline's Upper Station. 
             Grandview Avenue was then the High Street, and the area was just 
             beginning to be converted from farmland to homesites. 
             This pleasantly-situated acreage was an excellent area to absorb 
             some of the expanding population of the city, but the problem of 
             easy access was still to be solved. 
        </p>
        <p>Although plans for a freight and passenger incline are known to have 
           existed much earlier, financial backing was exceedingly hard to find
           --even the modest sum of $47,000--and actual construction was 
           delayed. Eventually, of course, difficulties were overcome and the 
           Incline was built. It was opened to the public May 20, 1877. The 
           Duquesne Incline was the first Pittsburgh incline designed and built 
           by Samuel Diescher, for Kirk Bigham and Associates. Mr. Diescher, an 
           engineer, had become the country's foremost builder of inclines. He 
           was also to design and build most of those that followed.
        </p>
        <p>At the time of its public opening, it was one of four inclined planes
           serving the summit of Coal Hill, which later came to be known as 
           Mount Washington. The Duquesne Incline was operated, from 1877 until 
           1962 by The Duquesne Inclined Plane Company. From 1964 until the 
           present, the Incline has been operated by the Society for the 
           Preservation of The Duquesne Heights Incline; it has been owned by 
           the Port Authority of Allegheny County.

        <h4>The Society for the Preservation of the Duquesne Heights Incline</h4>
        <p>The Society for the Preservation of the Duquesne Heights Incline was 
            formed in 1964 by the Duquesne Heights/Mount Washington neighborhood 
            group that had rescued, repaired, and reopened the Incline in 1963. 
            The purpose was to continue to restore and rehabilitate the cars, 
            equipment, and both stations, and to establish the entire operation 
            as a reliable commuter facility and a popular visitor attraction.  
            Memberships in the society are available, call for details.
