# Duquesne Incline Web Development
A fully responsive website for Pittsburgh's Duquesne Incline to allow for cross-device compatibility and to learn HTML/CSS/Javascript. I generated wireframes, created user stories, tested with potential users to clarify site navigation, and developed a functional, user-centered website.
